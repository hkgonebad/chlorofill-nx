            This project was built using modern web technologies including Nuxt 3 (migrated from Vue 3/Vite), and Bootstrap, demonstrating how to integrate external APIs into a dynamic web application with Server-Side Rendering. It also
            features light/dark mode theming and uses local storage for saving your favorite recipes and cocktails.
